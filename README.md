I am an undergraduate student studying Neuroscience at Boston University and I am excited to be introduced into the world of AI and Machine Learning! I specifically want to learn techniques that will complement computational neuroscience, such as creating neural networks that can mimic brain pathways. I am also interested in the application that this field has in medicinal and health sciences. I think this a great opportunity that will prepare me not only for future elective classes that I will take, but also I hope to gain skills that will make me a competitive candidate in the marketplace.
