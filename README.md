# Sure Start VAIL 2021 Program
A repository for the SureStart VAIL 2021 Program that I am completing as an AI and Machine Learning trainee. 
Program includes techincal skill training on:
- Machine learning
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision
- Data analytics & visualization
- Ethical AI development

### Day 1: (02/08/21): Introduction to SureStart
I am an undergraduate student studying Neuroscience at Boston University and I am excited to be introduced into the world of AI and Machine Learning! I specifically want to learn techniques that will complement computational neuroscience, such as creating neural networks that can mimic brain pathways. I am also interested in the application that this field has in medicinal and health sciences. I think this a great opportunity that will prepare me not only for future elective classes that I will take, but also I hope to gain skills that will make me a competitive candidate in the marketplace.

### Day 2: (02/09/21): Introduction to Machine Learning (ML) and Scikit-Learn

Materials for day 2 can be found [here.](Day 2 - INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING (ML) AND SCIKIT-LEARN/IRIS.pdf)

1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? 
Supervised Learning refers to a program that has been trained on a pre defined set of training examples. The main goal is to come up with a predictor function ```h(x)``` that uses mathematical algorithms to optimize this function so that the given data input ```x``` predicts the ```h(x)``` value.
Unsupervised Learning refers to a program that is given a bunch of data and must find patterns and relations in itself.

2. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: ```scikit-Learn``` has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
This statement is false because ```scikit-Learn``` is a library in python that provides unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. It does not have the power to visualize data, that is why we need to import other libraries to visualize it.
